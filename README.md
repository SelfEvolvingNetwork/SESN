# SESN: Comprehensive Technical Specification

## Description

This repository contains the **Comprehensive Technical Specification for the Self-Evolving Software Network (SESN)**.

The SESN is a dynamic, modular, and AI-driven architecture designed to autonomously translate user requirements into entirely new software capabilities. It features a three-layer framework and operates under a mandatory Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) supervision model to ensure stability and security during its self-evolution process.

The complete specification is detailed in the included PDF file.
